Geometry3D
==========

Geometry3D is a Java library which provides support for vector based calculations.

Currently, it is possible to create planes as well as lines, line segments and rays. The library is able to calculate the intersection of two lines and the intersection of a line with a plane. Support for calculating the intersection of two planes will be implemented soon.
